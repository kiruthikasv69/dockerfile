explanation 
migration refers to database schema migrations — i.e., updating the structure of your database (like creating tables, adding columns, indexes, etc.) before your main app starts.
Why It’s Needed

When you deploy an app (for example, your EasyShop app), your application might need a specific database structure (collections/tables/fields) to run correctly.
So before launching the main app container, you:

Run the migration container first.

It connects to MongoDB and executes migration scripts (like creating initial collections or inserting seed data).

Once it completes successfully, the app container starts.
